# Human-behavior-analysis
Human behavior analysis using OpenPose and Multiclass classification

This project describes the post process of OpenPOSE points. Since the image preserves the projective view of human pose, the algebric error is calculated to create small 
patch of points. Later they are trained using Logistic Regression (machine learning sigmoid function). Small data is used in the experiment to train 10 selected actions.

"More the data, better and accurate actions can be determined"
